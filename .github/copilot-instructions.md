# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

This repository currently contains only documentation and configuration directories. As the codebase evolves, update this file to guide AI agents and developers on project-specific workflows, architecture, and conventions.

## Current Structure
- `docs/`: Documentation (e.g., `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`)
- `.vscode/`: Editor settings

## Getting Started
- Review `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for project goals and implementation plans.
- No source code or build/test workflows are present yet.
- No project-specific conventions or patterns are established.

## How to Contribute
- As you add code, document major components, data flows, and integration points here.
- Reference key files and directories that exemplify important patterns.
- Update this file with any non-standard workflows, build/test commands, or integration details.

## Example (to update as codebase grows)
```markdown
- Main service entrypoint: `src/main.py`
- Domain logic: `src/domain/`
- External integrations: `src/integrations/`
- Build: `make build`
- Test: `pytest tests/`
```

## Resources
- [Implementation Plan](../docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- [VS Code Instructions Docs](https://aka.ms/vscode-instructions-docs)

*Update this file as the project develops to ensure AI agents have the context needed for effective contributions.*
